# AGENTS.md — safezip

**Package version**: See pyproject.toml
**Repository**: <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/safezip>
**Maintainer**: Artur Barseghyan <artur.barseghyan@gmail.com>

This file is for AI agents and developers using AI assistants to work on or with
safezip. It covers two distinct roles: **using** the package in application code,
and **developing/extending** the package itself.

---

## 1. Project Mission (Never Deviate)

> Hardened ZIP extraction for Python — secure by default, zero dependencies,
> production-grade.

- Secure defaults are never relaxed without an explicit caller decision.
- No external dependencies. Ever.
- The three-phase security model (Guard → Sandbox → Streamer) is preserved.
- No partial files on disk after a security abort.

---

## 2. Using safezip in Application Code

### Simple case

<!-- pytestfixture: file_zip -->
```python name=test_simple_case
from safezip import safe_extract

# Secure defaults protect against all common attacks
safe_extract("path/to/file.zip", "/var/files/extracted/")
```

### With monitoring and custom limits

<!-- pytestfixture: file_zip -->
```python name=test_with_monitoring_and_custom_limits
from safezip import SafeZipFile, SecurityEvent

def monitor(event: SecurityEvent) -> None:
    print(f"Security event: {event.event_type}")

with SafeZipFile(
    "path/to/file.zip",
    max_file_size=100 * 1024 * 1024,  # 100 MiB per member
    on_security_event=monitor,
) as zf:
    zf.extractall("/var/files/extracted/")
```

### Exception handling

All safezip exceptions inherit from `SafezipError`:

<!-- pytestfixture: file_zip -->
```python name=test_exception_handling
from safezip import (
    safe_extract,
    SafezipError,
    UnsafeZipError,          # path traversal or disallowed symlink
    CompressionRatioError,   # ZIP bomb attempt
    FileSizeExceededError,   # member too large
    TotalSizeExceededError,  # cumulative size exceeded
    FileCountExceededError,  # too many entries
    MalformedArchiveError,   # structurally invalid archive
    NestingDepthError,       # nested archive depth exceeded
)

try:
    safe_extract("path/to/file.zip", "/var/files/extracted/")
except UnsafeZipError:
    ...
except CompressionRatioError:
    ...
except SafezipError:
    # catch-all for any safezip violation
    ...
```

### Secure defaults reference

<!-- pytestfixture: file_zip -->
```python name=test_secure_defaults_reference
from safezip import SafeZipFile, SymlinkPolicy

SafeZipFile(
    "path/to/file.zip",
    max_file_size=1 * 1024**3,       # 1 GiB per member
    max_total_size=5 * 1024**3,      # 5 GiB total
    max_files=10_000,
    max_per_member_ratio=200.0,
    max_total_ratio=200.0,
    max_nesting_depth=3,
    symlink_policy=SymlinkPolicy.REJECT,
)
```

All limits are overridable via environment variables:

| Variable | Type | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SAFEZIP_MAX_FILE_SIZE` | int (bytes) | 1 GiB |
| `SAFEZIP_MAX_TOTAL_SIZE` | int (bytes) | 5 GiB |
| `SAFEZIP_MAX_FILES` | int | 10 000 |
| `SAFEZIP_MAX_PER_MEMBER_RATIO` | float | 200.0 |
| `SAFEZIP_MAX_TOTAL_RATIO` | float | 200.0 |
| `SAFEZIP_MAX_NESTING_DEPTH` | int | 3 |
| `SAFEZIP_SYMLINK_POLICY` | str | reject |

Resolution order: constructor argument > environment variable > hardcoded default.
Invalid env values are logged and silently ignored.

### What safezip does not do

- **Write mode** — `SafeZipFile` is read-only. It does not expose `open()`,
  `read()`, or any write-mode methods from `zipfile.ZipFile`.
- **Recursive extraction** — nested `.zip` members are extracted as raw files.
  Recursion, if needed, is the caller's responsibility via `_nesting_depth`.
- **Create OS symlinks** — `RESOLVE_INTERNAL` extracts symlink entries as
  regular files containing the target path as bytes. See section 5.

---

## 3. Architecture

Each extraction passes through three phases in order. Each phase owns exactly
one module. When adding a new check, identify the correct phase first.

| Phase | File | Runs | Raises |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Guard** | `_guard.py` | On `SafeZipFile.__init__()`, before any decompression | `FileCountExceededError`, `FileSizeExceededError`, `MalformedArchiveError` |
| **Sandbox** | `_sandbox.py` | Per member, before streaming begins | `UnsafeZipError` |
| **Streamer** | `_streamer.py` | Per member, during decompression | `FileSizeExceededError`, `TotalSizeExceededError`, `CompressionRatioError` |

**Guard** owns: file count limit, declared per-member size, ZIP64 consistency,
null bytes in filenames.

**Sandbox** owns: path traversal detection, absolute/UNC path rejection, Unicode
NFC normalisation, null-byte rejection, path length limit, symlink policy
(REJECT / IGNORE / RESOLVE_INTERNAL).

**Streamer** owns: per-member decompressed size, cumulative total size,
per-member ratio, cumulative ratio, atomic write contract (temp file → rename
on success, unlink on failure).

**Orchestration** (`_core.py`) — `SafeZipFile` and `safe_extract`. `_extract_one`
calls the three phases in order per member. Environment variable resolution,
security event emission, and symlink policy dispatch live here.

### Key files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/safezip/_core.py` | Public API, orchestration, env overrides, event emission |
| `src/safezip/_guard.py` | Phase A: static pre-checks |
| `src/safezip/_sandbox.py` | Phase B: path resolution, symlink policy |
| `src/safezip/_streamer.py` | Phase C: streaming extraction, atomic writes |
| `src/safezip/_exceptions.py` | Exception hierarchy (all inherit `SafezipError`) |
| `src/safezip/_events.py` | `SecurityEvent`, `SymlinkPolicy`, callback type |
| `src/safezip/tests/conftest.py` | All test archive fixtures |
| `pyproject.toml` | Build, ruff, mypy, pytest-cov configuration |
| `README.rst` | End-user documentation; keep in sync with code |

## 4. Security Principles

**1. Default limits are sacred.**
Never lower them in examples or generated code. If a user asks you to relax a
limit, warn about the tradeoff explicitly before complying.

**2. Atomicity is non-negotiable.**
Every member must follow: temp file → all checks pass → `replace()` to
destination. On any exception: `unlink(missing_ok=True)` the temp file. The
destination must never be created or modified if a check fails. No partial
files may remain on disk.

**3. Never merge phase responsibilities.**
Path checks belong in `_sandbox.py`. Static header checks in `_guard.py`.
Runtime byte checks in `_streamer.py`. Do not add path logic to the streamer
or size logic to the guard.

**4. Zero external dependencies.**
stdlib only. If you are considering adding an import that is not in the Python
standard library, the answer is no.

**5. Security events must not be suppressible.**
Exceptions raised inside `on_security_event` callbacks are caught and logged,
but the original security exception always propagates. Never let a broken
callback silently swallow a violation.

## 5. Known Intentional Behaviors — Do Not Treat as Bugs

### RESOLVE_INTERNAL extracts symlink entries as regular files

ZIP entries flagged as symlinks (via `external_attr` Unix mode `S_IFLNK`) are
written as regular files containing the link target path as bytes. Python's
`zipfile` does not create OS symlinks. The post-extraction `check_symlink` /
`_verify_symlink_chain` code in `_sandbox.py` is only reached if the OS creates
an actual symlink, which does not happen in the current extraction path.

This is **safe**: a regular file containing the text `"../escape.txt"` is
harmless. Real OS symlink creation and chain verification are
**not yet implemented**; they are future work (see the implementation note
below).

**If asked to implement real symlink support:** in `_extract_one`, for
`RESOLVE_INTERNAL` + `is_symlink_entry`, read the target bytes, call
`os.symlink(target, dest)`, then call `check_symlink(dest, base, policy)`,
unlink if unsafe. Add tests for both safe and escaping targets. Update README.

### compress_size == 0 skips the ratio check — this is correct

The ratio check in `_streamer.py` is gated on `compress_size > 0`. This is not
a vulnerability. Python's `zipfile` uses the central directory's `compress_size`
to control how many compressed bytes it reads. The only case where
`compress_size == 0` reaches the streamer for a member that successfully
decompresses is a genuinely empty member (zero bytes), for which skipping the
ratio check is correct behavior.

A crafted archive with `compress_size=0` in the central directory but non-empty
content is rejected by Python's `zipfile` with `BadZipFile` (CRC failure) before
the streamer is reached. This has been empirically verified. **Do not attempt to
"fix" this skip.**

### Nested archives are extracted as raw files

Members with ZIP-like extensions (`.zip`, `.jar`, `.whl`, `.egg`, etc.) are
extracted as opaque blobs. `SafeZipFile` does not auto-recurse. The
`_nesting_depth` parameter and `NestingDepthError` exist to guard against
runaway recursion if a caller implements manual recursion.

### In-memory archives (BinaryIO) receive full overlap detection

When `SafeZipFile` is instantiated with a `BinaryIO` (e.g., `BytesIO`) instead
of a filesystem path, the Guard phase now spills the buffer to a temporary
file to run `detect_zip_bomb()`. This ensures Fifield-style overlap detection
and extra-field quoting checks are applied to in-memory archives, closing a
previous bypass. The buffer position is restored after detection so the
caller's `zipfile.ZipFile` instance is not disturbed.

## 6. Agent Workflow: Adding Features or Fixing Bugs

When asked to add a feature or fix a bug, follow these steps in order:

1. **Check the mission** — Does the change preserve zero deps, secure defaults,
   and the three-phase model?
2. **Identify the correct phase** — Guard (static/header), Sandbox (path/policy),
   or Streamer (runtime/bytes).
3. **For bug fixes: write the regression fixture first** — Add a programmatic
   archive fixture to `src/safezip/tests/conftest.py` that reproduces the bug.
   The test must fail before your fix.
4. **Implement the change** in the correct phase file.
5. **Add/update exceptions** in `_exceptions.py` if a new error type is needed
   (inherit from `SafezipError`).
6. **Add event emission** in `_core.py` (`self._emit_event("event_type")`) if
   the check fires inside `_extract_one`.
7. **Export** new public symbols from `__init__.py` and `__all__`.
8. **Write tests:**
   - Unit test in `test_[phase].py` (e.g., `test_streamer.py`).
   - Integration test in `test_integration.py` verifying no partial files remain.
   - Legitimate-input test confirming the happy path still works.
9. **Update documentation** if you modify public API, CLI, or default limits,
   by running the `update-documentation` skill after committing. It will scan
   code vs docs and auto‑fix misalignments.
10. **MUST run:** Either single environment
    test `make test-env ENV=py312` or test all environments `make test`.
11. **MUST run:** `make pre-commit`.
12. If `pip-audit` fails on `docs/requirements.txt`, run
    the `make compile-requirements-upgrade` command.
    > **Note:** `docs/requirements.txt` targets Python ≥ 3.12 (built on
    > ReadTheDocs with Python 3.14, or locally on Python 3.13). Some pinned
    > packages (e.g. `ipython>=9`) require Python ≥ 3.12 and are intentional.
    > Do **not** downgrade them to satisfy older Python versions.

### Acceptable new features

- Windows reserved filename detection (Phase B / Sandbox).
- Additional event types for new violation categories.
- Optional recursive extraction (caller-controlled, guarded by `_nesting_depth`).
- Real OS symlink creation under `RESOLVE_INTERNAL` (see section 5).

### Forbidden

- Adding any external dependency.
- Lowering default limits.
- Bypassing or merging phases.
- Writing directly to the destination path (must use temp file).
- Exposing write-mode or `open()`/`read()` methods on `SafeZipFile`.

---

## 7. Testing Rules

### All tests must run inside Docker

```sh
make test                   # full matrix (Python 3.10–3.14)
make test-env ENV=py312     # single version
make shell                  # interactive shell
```

Do not run `pytest` directly on the host machine. Malicious test archives must
not touch the host filesystem.

### Test layout

```text
src/safezip/tests/
    conftest.py          — all archive fixtures (add new ones here)
    test_guard.py        — Phase A tests
    test_sandbox.py      — Phase B tests
    test_streamer.py     — Phase C tests
    test_integration.py  — end-to-end tests
```

The **root `conftest.py`** (project root) is for `pytest-codeblock` documentation
testing only. Do not add security fixtures there.

### Fixture rules

- Craft all test archives programmatically using `struct` or `zipfile`. Do not
  commit pre-built `.zip` files.
- Use `tmp_path` for all output. Never write to a fixed path.

### Required assertions for every security abort test

```python
# 1. pytest.raises wraps the full operation, not just extractall
with pytest.raises(SpecificError):
    with SafeZipFile(...) as zf:
        zf.extractall(dest)

# 2. Atomicity: no partial files remain
remaining = [f for f in dest.rglob("*") if not f.is_dir()]
assert not remaining
```

### Checklist for every new security check

- [ ] Fixture in `conftest.py` that triggers the violation
- [ ] Test asserting the correct exception is raised
- [ ] Test asserting no partial files remain after abort
- [ ] Test asserting a legitimate archive still extracts correctly
- [ ] Integration test in `test_integration.py`
- [ ] Event emission tested if applicable

---

## 8. Coding Conventions

Run all linting checks:

```sh
make pre-commit
```

### Formatting

- Line length: **88 characters** (ruff).
- Import sorting: `isort`; `safezip` is `known-first-party`.
- Target: `py310`. Run `make ruff` to check. `ruff fix = true` auto-fixes on
  commit — do not fight the formatter.

### Ruff rules in effect

`B`, `C4`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `I`, `ISC`, `INP`, `N`, `PERF`, `Q`, `SIM`.

Explicitly ignored:

| Rule | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `G004` | f-strings in logging calls are allowed |
| `ISC003` | implicit string concatenation across lines is allowed |
| `PERF203` | `try/except` in loops allowed in `conftest.py` only |

### Style

- Every non-test module must have `__all__`, `__author__`, `__copyright__`,
  `__license__` at module level.
- Logger: always `logging.getLogger("safezip.security")`. Never use `__name__`.
- Log member names truncated to 256 characters in `extra` dicts (privacy).
- Always chain exceptions: `raise X(...) from exc`.
- Type annotations on all public functions. Use `Optional[X]` (not `X | None`)
  to match the existing codebase.
- `SecurityEvent` must never include member names, paths, or filesystem
  information — `event_type`, `archive_hash`, and `timestamp` only.

### Pull requests

Target the `dev` branch only. Never open a PR directly to `main`.

## 9. Prompt Templates

**Explaining usage to a user:**
> You are an expert in secure Python file handling. Explain how to use safezip
> for [task]. Start with secure defaults. Include exception handling. Note that
> symlink entries are extracted as regular files, not OS symlinks.

**Implementing a new feature:**
> Extend safezip with [feature]. Follow the AGENTS.md agent workflow (section 6):
> identify the correct phase, implement, add tests verifying atomicity and events,
> update README. Preserve zero external dependencies and secure defaults.

**Fixing a bug:**
> Reproduce [bug] with a new programmatic fixture in conftest.py. The test must
> fail before the fix. Then fix in the correct phase file. Add tests asserting
> the correct exception, no partial files on disk, and that legitimate archives
> still extract successfully.

**Reviewing a change:**
> Review this safezip change against AGENTS.md: Does it preserve zero deps?
> Does it maintain the three-phase model? Does it follow the atomic write
> contract? Are all new checks tested with both violation and legitimate inputs?
